# Todo App :white_check_mark:

This application allows users to add and remove todo and goal items. Users can also toggle todo items as they complete them. This project demonstrates the basics of a React-Redux app. The application has been broken down into 4 distinct components:
* `App` - Holds `Todos` and `Goals` components
* `Goals` - Displays a list of the user's goals
* `Todo` - Displays a list of the user's todos, and if they are completed
* `List` - Displays the individual item and text in a list
* `Add` - Displays the input form to add todos and goals
